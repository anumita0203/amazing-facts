A fish called Tiktaalik that lived 375 million years ago had shoulders, elbows, legs, wrists, a neck and many other basic parts that eventually became part of us.
The Sun will swell to a red giant and swallow up the Earth in about 7.5 billion years.
The Amygdala, a part of your brain that discourages you from doing anything risky, appeared in the earliest vertebrates around 550 million years ago. The Pre-frontal Cortex, which is the thinking part of our brain responsible for much of human progress, appeared around 4 million years ago. It's really easy for the Amygdala to override the Pre-frontal Cortex.
Dopamine as a reward mechanism appeared at a time when calories and short-term gratification in general were scarce. Its purpose was to motivate the organism to work hard to obtain that reward, because the reward increased chances of survival. It has now been hijacked by various entities to keep you glued to them and earn advertising revenue for them. Now our Dopamine pathways are short-circuited, and don't do much for our chances of survival.
